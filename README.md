# RBLX-CONFIGS

    Best Performance: Focuses on maximum performance by lowering graphics quality, disabling post-processing, and optimizing frame rates, ideal for users seeking high responsiveness over visual fidelity.

    Graphics Model: Prioritizes a specific graphics rendering model using Vulkan, targeting high FPS and fixed graphics quality, tailored for systems where graphics rendering consistency is key.

    Optimal: Balances between performance and graphics quality, leveraging voxel rendering and Vulkan while minimizing post-processing effects, aimed at delivering a balanced user experience with good performance and visual quality.
